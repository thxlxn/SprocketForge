# SFEDIT - Sprocket File EDITor
I haven't compiled this into an .exe yet, so you can run it from your IDE or through the terminal. Just don't forget that the functions.py supplement has to be in the same directory.
Plans include (but not limited to):
- Advanced track and suspension modifications
- Structure merging
- Crew member modifications
- Custom era creator

## Thickness Editor
Changes the armor thickness of every single face of the selected compartment/vehicle. The only practical usage for this is compartments with tiny geometry where setting the thickness below 5mm is not possible in-game.

## 3D Visualizer
Tries to replicate the feature available in Sprocket's official Discord server but with the edition of a slider that lets you spin the output image.
Do keep in mind that loading a **really heavy** blueprint can lead to your machine running out-of-memory. Be careful with this... <sub>or don't, that's up to you</sub>
