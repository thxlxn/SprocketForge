The universal tool for headache-less file editing in the popular video game Sprocket by Hamish Dunn.

> This whole thing is obviously still in progress and I do not have any ETAs. I plan on rolling out random useful (or not) features whenever I have free time in-between uni stuff. Any feedback is highly appreciated as I am still learning >.< <br>

Plans include (but not limited to):
- Advanced track and suspension modifications
- Structure merging
- Crew member modifications
- Custom era creator

## 📏 Thickness Editor
Changes the armor thickness of every single face of the selected compartment/vehicle. 
The only practical usage for this is compartments with tiny geometry where setting the thickness below 5mm is not possible in-game.

## 🖼️ 3D Visualizer
Tries to replicate the feature available in Sprocket's official Discord server but with the edition of a slider that lets you spin the output image.
Do keep in mind that loading a **really heavy** blueprint can lead to your machine running out-of-memory.
Be careful with this... <sub>or don't, that's up to you</sub>

## 📁 Blueprint Packager
The packager lets the user upload .blueprint files, automatically retrieves all used local decals and packs them into a .zip file together for the blueprints.
This allows for easy sharing of your blueprints without having to remember the decals you have used. 
<sub>custom paint packaging is in progress</sub>
